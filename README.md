# PolyBeast and PolyBeats Machine

[Live Site](https://intuitiveharmony.github.io/breeze_front/) | [Front End Repo](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/breeze_front) | [API](https://breeze-back.herokuapp.com/api/sequences) | [Back End Repo](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/breeze_back) |

This instrument is a collaboration between Jey Ulmer and Jason Horst.  We set out to make a poly rhythmic sequencer and sample based drum machine in which the user is able to create, save, edit and delete new sequences.  Breeze was built using React, Redux, Django, Postgresql, Reactronica, and Tone.js.  The back end is hosted using Heroku and the front end is deployed using Github pages. Piano Roll keys, as well as any key code can be found here javascriptkeycode.com.


## Challenges

The biggest challenge in this project was learning redux.  We spent the first week studying and struggling with this new technology.  Eventually we were able to start and understand it and start implementing it into our workflow.   

The other major challenge was to get our external libraries Reactronica and Tone.js to behave in the way we intended.  Reactronica was working perfectly at first, however once more features were added the functionality of Reactonica seemed to decline and become unpredictable.
