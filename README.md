# Breeze Beats Machine

[Live Site](https://intuitiveharmony.github.io/breeze_front/) | [Front End Repo](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/breeze_front) | [API](https://breeze-back.herokuapp.com/api/sequences) | [Back End Repo](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/breeze_back) |

This is a collaboration between Jey Ulmer and Jason Horst.  We set out to make a poly rhythmic sequencer and sample based drum machine using React, Redux, Django, Postgresql, Reactronica, and Tone.js.  The back end is hosted using Heroku and the front end is deployed using Github pages.
